The Kaprekar Number Calculator is a simple web application designed to determine whether a given number is a Kaprekar number. A Kaprekar number is an integer whose square can be split into two parts that add up to the original number. For example, 45 is a Kaprekar number because \(45^2 = 2025\) and \(20 + 25 = 45\).
