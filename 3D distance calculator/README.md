## Project Overview
The 3D Distance Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to compute the Euclidean distance between two points in a 3D coordinate system. Users can input the coordinates of two points, and the distance is calculated and displayed upon clicking a button.

## Features
* User Input: Input fields for coordinates of two points in 3D space.
* Distance Calculation: Computes the distance using the Euclidean distance formula.
* Results Display: Displays the calculated distance on the screen.

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Enter the coordinates of Point 1 (x1, y1, z1) in the first input field.
3. Enter the coordinates of Point 2 (x2, y2, z2) in the second input field.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to compute the distance.
5. The calculated distance will be displayed below the button.
